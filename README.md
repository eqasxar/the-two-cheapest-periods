# the-two-cheapest-periods
Thanks to Martijn van der Pol https://github.com/TheFes/cheapest-energy-hours, based on his macro, 
an automatic calculator of the two cheapest periods was created with the help of copilot, which activates test_relay.
This test_relay can be replaced with any other device that will operate or charge the battery during the cheapest hours.
